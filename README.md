# File Zen

File Zen is an extension that lets you create lists of related files to more easily navigate large projects. This allows you to focus on just the files that matter for a given task or feature without having to continually scroll through the Explorer tree.

## Features

- Toggle the currently open file using the Toggle keyboard shortcut
  - <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+N</kbd> (Windows)
  - <kbd>⌥⌘N</kbd> (Mac)
- Give the file a label for easier identification

### View Flexibility

Drag and drop File Zen views to different parts of the VS Code UI. This makes it easy to access your lists while working alongside the main Explorer view.
